		<h4>Singapore Airlines has been named the best airline in the world for 2018 by the leading consumer-aviation website Skytrax. “Singapore Airlines is honored to be named World’s Best Airline in the Skytrax awards, and I dedicate it to the 26,000 SIA Group employees who focus every day on delivering the world’s best travel experience to our customers,” Singapore Airlines CEO Goh Choon Phong said in a statement. “The recognition will further motivate us to improve upon the three main pillars of our brand promise – product leadership, service excellence and network connectivity – to ensure we retain our competitive advantage and continue to meet and exceed customer expectations.”</h4>
